    Decorator to have the underlying coroutine be called when two conditions apply:
    1. No conventional command was found for the incoming message.
    2. The command matches the here provided regular expression.

    Arguments:
        regex (str):
            Regular expression to match the command.
        case_sensitive (bool):
            Whether to match case-sensitively (using the re.IGNORECASE flag).
        full_message (bool):
            If this is True, will try to match against the full message. Otherwise,
            only the word will be matched against.
        pass_match (bool):
            If this is True, the match object will be passed as an argument toward the command
            function.
        prefixless (bool):
            If this is True, the rule can match whether or not the prefix is present. Otherwise, it
            acts similarly to a command, only being considered if the message starts with our
            prefix. The prefix itself should not be part of the regex for non-prefixless rules.
        after (Rule):
            A rule which this one must be considered after, for some rudimentary prioritization.

    Please note that *regex* can match anywhere within the string, it need not match the entire
    string. If you wish to change this behaviour, use '^' and '$' in your regex.

    Ordering is actually ensured by requiring access to *after*, by making sure that it has been
    registered before this one.

    Raises:
        DuplicateRuleException: If the same rule has already been registered.
        RuleNotPresentException: If the rule *after* hasn't yet been registered.
